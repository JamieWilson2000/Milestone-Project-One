Milestone Project One
Jamie Wilson

Main Idea:
As a hobbyist music composer/producer I am constantly scrolling through the internet, 
reading reviews, tips, methods and generally trying to keep abreast of the constantly 
changing world of music technology. So I thought my project should centre around a site
that I myself would be interested in visiting on a regular basis.

I have arrived at the title of "The Musical .wav with a wave icon to instill the 
pronounciation of wave instead of wav.(maybe I'm trying to be too clever!?!)
A monthly website aimed at musicians young and old, experienced and unskilled, 
with the aim to educate and inform those who have an interest in creating music.

Milestone Project One
Jamie Wilson

Main Idea:

As a hobbyist music composer/producer I am constantly scrolling through the internet, 
reading reviews, tips, methods and generally trying to keep abreast of the constantly 
changing world of music technology. So I thought my project should centre around a site
that I myself would be interested in visiting on a regular basis.

The basis of the idea:

A monthly website aimed at musicians young and old, experienced and unskilled, 
with the aim to educate and inform those who have an interest in creating music.

Page Content:

The page will consist of:
A main header with logo,
A main banner with a main feature,
A regular feature "meet the artists",
A regular feature "tech news",
A "this month" feature which would target a different aspect of music technology each month,
and finally a footer contining social links and copyright/ownership information.

General Typography and styling:

I have decided to go with a style of text where I refrain from using capitals,I 
personally like this style but to some I appreciate it can look un-attractive. 

Methods used:

For the zooming animation used in the landing page front image, I refered back to the "Love running" module 
and used the guidance provided there to acheive the effect. I chose not to alter it other than increase the animation 
time to 3s because I felt happy with the general look of the effect.
